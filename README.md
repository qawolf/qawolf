## 🐺 What is QA Wolf?

We aspire to be the easiest way for developers to set up browser tests.

We found browser testing too difficult and often gave up on it entirely in our previous jobs. We built QA Wolf for people like us who want to ship confidently 🚀 by creating browser tests easily.

<br/>

## 🤔 Is QA Wolf a good fit for you?

<br/>

| 🐺 Yes                                                                                              | 🦌 No                                                                      |

| ✅ You are a developer, or at least comfortable with code                                           | ✖️ You are not comfortable with code                                       |
| ✅ You want to get going quickly with an out of the box solution                                    | ✖️ You need a lot of configuration options                                 |
| ✅ You want to create tests without installing / learning a test framework                          | ✖️ You don't want your browser tests written in JavaScript with Playwright |
| ✅ You want to run your tests against a public URL on deployment (Netlify, Vercel) or on a schedule | ✖️ You want to run your tests in your own CI                               |
