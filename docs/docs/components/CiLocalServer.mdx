To run your tests against your local server, open the `./azure-pipelines.yml` file.

You'll notice a commented out step of the workflow called `Start local server` (lines 21-22 of the default generated file):

```yaml
# # Start local server
# - script: npm run start & npx wait-on http://localhost:3000
```

Comment in this code, and edit it as you like. The example first runs the script `npm run start`, and then waits for the URL `localhost:3000` to be available:

```yaml
# Start local server
- script: npm run start & npx wait-on http://localhost:3000
```

You may want to replace `npm run start` with a different command, or `localhost:3000` with a different URL.

See [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/utility/command-line?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) to learn more about running commands.
