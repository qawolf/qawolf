To configure when your tests run, open the `./.circleci/config.yml` file.

Near the bottom of the file (line 34), you'll see some commented out code to run your tests on a schedule:

```yaml
# ...
# workflows:
#   version: 2
#   on_schedule:
#     jobs:
#       - build
#     triggers:
#       - schedule:
#           # test on schedule using cron syntax
#           cron: "0 * * * *" # every hour
#           filters:
#             branches:
#               only:
#                 - master
```

Comment in this code to run your tests on a schedule. How often your tests run is specified using [cron syntax](https://crontab.guru/). By default, your tests will run every hour on the hour:

```yaml
# ...
workflows:
  version: 2
   on_schedule:
     jobs:
       - build
     triggers:
       - schedule:
           # test on schedule using cron syntax
           cron: "0 * * * *" # every hour
           filters:
             branches:
               only:
                 - master
```

You can change the value passed to the `cron` key to run your tests on a different schedule:

```yaml
# ...
workflows:
  version: 2
   on_schedule:
     jobs:
       - build
     triggers:
       - schedule:
           # test on schedule using cron syntax
           cron: "0 0 * * *" # every day at midnight
           filters:
             branches:
               only:
                 - master
```

See [CircleCI documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/#scheduling-a-workflow) to learn more about running tests on a schedule.

To configure when your tests run, open the `./.github/workflows/qawolf.yml` file.

Near the top of the file (lines 7-9), you'll see some commented out code to run your tests on a schedule:

```yaml
name: qawolf
on:
  push:
    # test every branch
    # edit below if you only want certain branches tested
    branches: "*"
  # schedule:
  #   # test on schedule using cron syntax
  #   - cron: "0 * * * *" # every hour
# ...
```

    # test on schedule using cron syntax
    - cron: "0 0 * * *" # every day at midnight
# ...
```

If you do not want your tests to run when a commit is pushed, you can also remove or comment out the `push` code block (lines 3-6):

```yaml
name: qawolf
on:
  schedule:
    # test on schedule using cron syntax
    - cron: "0 * * * *" # every hour
# ...
```
