To set environment variables, open the `./azure-pipelines.yml` file.

You'll notice a section for environment variables (line 25 in the generated default file):

```yaml
# ...
env:
  # configure tests with environment variables
  QAW_ARTIFACT_PATH: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/artifacts
# ...
```

If your environment variable is not sensitive, you can set its value directly. To do this, just add another line under the `env` key. In the example below, we set `LOGIN_USERNAME` to `spirit`:

```yaml
# ...
env:
  # configure tests with environment variables
  QAW_ARTIFACT_PATH: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/artifacts
  LOGIN_USERNAME: spirit
# ...
```

Now let's include an environment variable for a sensitive input value, like a password. Rather than pass its value directly, you should use a secret variable. First you need to add set the secret in Azure Devops. See [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbatch#secret-variables) for instructions.

You can now use your secret in your workflow file by setting your environment variable to `$(MY_SECRET)`.

In the example below, we set `LOGIN_PASSWORD` to `$(SECRET_PASSWORD)`:

```yaml
# ...
env:
  # configure tests with environment variables
  QAW_ARTIFACT_PATH: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/artifacts
  LOGIN_USERNAME: spirit
  LOGIN_PASSWORD: $(SECRET_PASSWORD)
# ...
```

In our test file, we use `process.env.LOGIN_PASSWORD` rather than hard coding the password value. See [our guide on changing input values](change_input_values#use-environment-variables) to learn more about removing sensitive input values from tests.

<TabItem value="circleci">

To set environment variables, open the `./.circleci/config.yml` file.

You'll notice a section for environment variables (line 26 in the generated default file):

```yaml
# ...
environment:
  # configure tests with environment variables
  QAW_ARTIFACT_PATH: /tmp/artifacts
# ...
```

If your environment variable is not sensitive, you can set its value directly. To do this, just add another line under the `env` key. In the example below, we set `LOGIN_USERNAME` to `spirit`:

```yaml
# ...
environment:
  # configure tests with environment variables
  QAW_ARTIFACT_PATH: /tmp/artifacts
  LOGIN_USERNAME: spirit
# ...
```

Now let's include an environment variable for a sensitive input value, like a password. Rather than pass its value directly, you should use a secret variable. First you need to add set the secret in CircleCI. See [CircleCI documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project) for instructions.

You can now use your secret in your workflow file by setting your environment variable to `${MY_SECRET}`.

In the example below, we set `LOGIN_PASSWORD` to `${SECRET_PASSWORD}`:

```yaml
# ...
environment:
  # configure tests with environment variables
  QAW_ARTIFACT_PATH: /tmp/artifacts
  LOGIN_USERNAME: spirit
  LOGIN_PASSWORD: ${SECRET_PASSWORD}
# ...
```

In our test file, we use `process.env.LOGIN_PASSWORD` rather than hard coding the password value. See [our guide on changing input values](change_input_values#use-environment-variables) to learn more about removing sensitive input values from tests.

<TabItem value="github">

To set environment variables, open the `./.github/workflows/qawolf.yml` file.

You'll notice a section for environment variables after `- run: npx qawolf test` (line 40 in the generated default file):

```yaml
# ...
env:
  # configure tests with environment variables
  QAW_ARTIFACT_PATH: ${{ github.workspace }}/artifacts
# ...
```

If your environment variable is not sensitive, you can set its value directly. To do this, just add another line under the `env` key. In the example below, we set `LOGIN_USERNAME` to `spirit`:

```yaml
# ...
env:
  # configure tests with environment variables
  QAW_ARTIFACT_PATH: ${{ github.workspace }}/artifacts
  LOGIN_USERNAME: spirit
# ...
```

Now let's include an environment variable for a sensitive input value, like a password. Rather than pass its value directly, which would involve checking it into GitHub, you should use a [GitHub secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets).

First you need to add the secret to your GitHub respository, which is done in the repository settings. The video below shows how to add a secret to your repository:

<video controls title="add secret to GitHub repository" width="100%">
  <source
    src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs.qawolf.com/guides/github_secret.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

See [GitHub Actions documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets) for more details on creating secrets.

You can now use your secret in your `.github/workflows/qawolf.yml` file by setting your environment variable to `${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}`.

In the example below, we set `LOGIN_PASSWORD` to `${{ secrets.PASSWORD }}`:

```yaml
# ...
env:
  # configure tests with environment variables
  QAW_ARTIFACT_PATH: ${{ github.workspace }}/artifacts
  LOGIN_USERNAME: spirit
  LOGIN_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PASSWORD }}
# ...
```

In our test file, we use `process.env.LOGIN_PASSWORD` rather than hard coding the password value. See [our guide on changing input values](change_input_values#use-environment-variables) to learn more about removing sensitive input values from tests.

<TabItem value="gitlab">

To set environment variables, open the `./.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

You'll notice a section for environment variables (line 14 in the generated default file):

```yaml
# ...
variables:
  # configure tests with environment variables
  QAW_ARTIFACT_PATH: $CI_PROJECT_DIR/artifacts
# ...
```

If your environment variable is not sensitive, you can set its value directly. To do this, just add another line under the `environment` key. In the example below, we set `LOGIN_USERNAME` to `spirit`:

```yaml
# ...
variables:
  # configure tests with environment variables
  QAW_ARTIFACT_PATH: $CI_PROJECT_DIR/artifacts
  LOGIN_USERNAME: spirit
# ...
```

Now let's include an environment variable for a sensitive input value, like a password. Rather than pass its value directly, you should use a secret variable. First you need to add set the secret in GitLab. See [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#protected-environment-variables) for instructions.

You can now use your secret in your workflow file by setting your environment variable to `$MY_SECRET`.

In the example below, we set `LOGIN_PASSWORD` to `$SECRET_PASSWORD`:

```yaml
# ...
variables:
  # configure tests with environment variables
  QAW_ARTIFACT_PATH: $CI_PROJECT_DIR/artifacts
  LOGIN_PASSWORD: $SECRET_PASSWORD
# ...
```

In our test file, we use `process.env.LOGIN_PASSWORD` rather than hard coding the password value. See [our guide on changing input values](change_input_values#use-environment-variables) to learn more about removing sensitive input values from tests.
