title: 🔥 Smoke Tests with Alerts
---

You may have experienced this: someone pushed code to production and now a critical user workflow is broken. Despite your team’s best efforts, the bug slipped through. How could you have caught it before a user did? 😱

In this tutorial, we’ll learn about smoke testing as a line of defense against bugs on production. We’ll set up smoke tests on a website, and build an alerting system that tells us when something isn’t working. Let’s get started!

## What are smoke tests?

Smoke tests are tests that cover the most important functionality of an application. For example, on Netflix the critical user workflows include signing in, searching for a show, and watching a show. The term “smoke test” originated in hardware repair, where a machine would fail the smoke test if it caught on fire when turned on. 🔥

[According to Microsoft](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/ms182613(v=vs.80)?redirectedfrom=MSDN>), “smoke testing is the most cost-effective method for identifying and fixing defects in software” after code reviews. This is because smoke tests are **not** intended to cover every permutation and edge case. Instead, smoke tests verify that the critical functionality isn't broken to the point where further testing would be unnecessary.

The book [<i>Lessons Learned in Software Testing</i>](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/lessons-learned-in/9780471081128/) summarizes it well: "smoke tests broadly cover product features in a limited time...if key features don't work or if key bugs haven't yet been fixed, your team won't waste further time installing or testing."

## Get started

Now let’s create our first smoke test! First, make sure that you have [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). To get started, either create a new [Node.js](ttps://nodejs.org) project, or change directories into an existing one.

To create a new project, run the following in the command line:

```bash
mkdir smoke-tests
cd smoke-tests
npm init -y
```

You can follow along in this example GitHub repository. [Your code base should now look like this.](https://github.com/qawolf/tutorials-smoke-tests/tree/fd9b2f7f5c1c42ab5639172243317b6c6c336b00)

Now we need to install the `qawolf` [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qawolf). `qawolf` is an open source Node.js library that generates [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) test code from your browser interactions. It also allows you to quickly [set up running your tests on a schedule in various CI providers](set_up_ci).

In the command line, run the following to install `qawolf` as a dev dependency in your project:

```bash
npm i -D qawolf
```

[Your code base should now look like this.](https://github.com/qawolf/tutorials-smoke-tests/tree/ee0ed9f579bdb7110b7a5b4f2a730de4616b8025)

## Creating a smoke test

Now let's generate our smoke test code. This tutorial will record a test on a [simple todo application](http://todomvc.com/examples/react). Specifically, we'll create a todo item, complete it, and clear completed todos.

When we run the following in the command line, a Chromium browser will open and capture any actions we take (clicking, typing, etc.). You can optionally replace `http://todomvc.com/examples/react` with a different URL, and `myFirstSmokeTest` with a different name.

```bash
npx qawolf record http://todomvc.com/examples/react myFirstSmokeTest
```
