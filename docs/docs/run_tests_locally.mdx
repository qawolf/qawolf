In the [previous guide](create_a_test) we created our first browser test for [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/react). We will now run our test locally to verify that it works.

## TL;DR

<BrowserCodeBlock />

## Run a test locally

Let's run our test locally to confirm it works. In the command line, run the following [command](api/cli#npx-qawolf-test-name). If applicable, replace `myFirstTest` with your test name:

```bash
npx qawolf test myFirstTest
```

A Chromium browser will open and the test will run using the [Jest](https://jestjs.io) test runner. See the video below for an example:

    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

If you're having trouble running your test, please [chat with us](https://gitter.im/qawolf/community) or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf/issues/new)!

## Run all tests locally

To run all of your tests locally, run:

```bash
npx qawolf test
```

After running this command, your tests will run in parallel to the extent possible. Each test will run on a separate Chromium browser.

If you prefer to run your tests sequentially, you can use the [`--runInBand` Jest flag](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli#--runinband):

```bash
npx qawolf test --runInBand
```

## Test across browsers

QA Wolf is built on top of Microsoft's [Playwright library](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright), which automates the [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new), and [WebKit](https://webkit.org) browsers with a single API. You can therefore run your tests on any of the supported browsers without having to change your code.

To run your tests on a specific browser, use the `--chromium`, `--firefox`, or `--webkit` [flags](api/cli#npx-qawolf-test-name). To run your tests on all browsers, use the `--all-browsers` flag. If you run your tests across browsers, each test will run three times: once on Chromium, once on Firefox, and once on WebKit.

If no flag is provided, QA Wolf will default to running your tests on Chromium.

## Next steps

Congratulations - you've mastered the basics of creating and running browser tests! üéâ

There are a few places you can go from here:

- [Run your tests in CI](run_tests_in_ci)
- Learn how to edit your test code:
  - [Use the REPL](use_the_repl)
  - [Add assertions](add_assertions)
  - [Use custom selectors](use_custom_selectors)
  - [Change input values](change_input_values)
