:::tip TL;DR

- [Create a workflow file](#create-workflow-file) to run your tests in your CI provider if you haven't already:

```bash
npm init qawolf
```

- Each test run includes [debug artifacts](#debug) like a video recording and logs
- You can also [run your tests against your local server](#run-tests-against-your-local-server), [use environment variables](#use-environment-variables), and [run tests on a schedule](#run-tests-on-a-schedule) in CI

:::

<br />

Now that we [created a browser test](create_a_test) and [ran it locally](run_tests_locally), let's run our tests in CI.

## Create workflow file

To create a workflow file for your CI provider, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm init qawolf
```

You will be prompted to set up GitHub Actions.

```bash
? Set up CI with GitHub Actions? (y/N)
```

<CiCreateWorkflow />

Now your tests will run whenever someone pushes a commit to any branch.

The rest of this guide covers common use cases of running your tests in CI:

- [Debug](#debug)
- [Run your tests against your local server](#run-tests-against-your-local-server)
- [Use environment variables](#use-environment-variables)
- [Run your tests on a schedule](#run-tests-on-a-schedule)

## Debug

By default, every test run includes debug artifacts like a video recording and detailed logs. These help you better understand your tests and debug failures.

Your debug artifacts are uploaded in a folder called `qawolf`, which has the following structure. Artifacts for each test are stored in separate folders, with the folder named after the test like `myTest.test.js`:

```bash
qawolf
├── myFirstTest.test.js
│   └── video_0_1583958809136.mp4
│   └── logs_0_1583958809136.txt
│   └── video_1_1583958809136.mp4
│   └── logs_1_1583958809136.txt
├── mySecondTest.test.js
│   └── video_0_1583958809227.mp4
│   └── logs_0_1583958809227.txt
# etc
```

If you ran your tests on [multiple browsers](run_tests_locally#test-across-browsers), you will see a separate folder for each browser under the test folder.

The file called `video_0_${timestamp}.mp4` is a video recording of your test. This allows you to watch your test run in the browser. The `0` in the file name refers to the index of the page that was recorded. If your tests involve multiple pages (for example, sign in with Twitter), a video of each page is saved separately. Page index starts at `0`, so the video for the first page in your test will be saved at `video_0_${timestamp}.mp4`.

Video is currently only supported on Chromium. We are [waiting for Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/1158) to add support for Firefox and WebKit.

Console logs are saved in the `logs_0_${timestamp}.txt` file. As with the video, the `0` refers to the index of the page the logs are from.

To view your debug artifacts in CI, follow the instructions below for your provider.

<CiArtifacts />

## Run tests against your local server

You may want to run your tests against your local server, which would allow you to test on a URL like `localhost:3000`.

In this guide, we assume you have a script that you can run to start your local server. For example, a common script to start a Node.js server is `npm run start`.

To run your tests against your local server, follow the instructions below for your CI provider.

<CiLocalServer />

## Use environment variables

You may want to configure your tests by setting [environment variables](api/environment_variables).

Depending on whether the environment variable contains sensitive information, you can pass it directly in your workflow file or set it in your CI provider.

To use environment variables, follow the instructions below for your CI provider.

<CiEnvironmentVariables />

## Run tests on a schedule

By default, the [generated workflow file](#create-workflow-file) is configured to run tests whenever someone pushes a commit to any branch. You can edit this file to run tests on a schedule instead of or in addition to every commit.

To run your tests on a schedule, follow the instructions below for your CI provider.

<CiRunOnSchedule />
