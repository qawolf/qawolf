<Header>What is QA Wolf?</Header>

Hi there - thanks for checking out QA Wolf üê∫

Our mission is to help developers ship confidently. QA Wolf is an <a href="https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf" target="_blank">open source tool</a> for setting up browser tests on your web application.

We make browser testing (also called end-to-end testing) easy in a few ways:

- <strong>No install:</strong> Create and run your tests from the browser - no installation
  or setup required.
- <strong>Auto create code:</strong> Your actions are converted to test code, so
  you can skip writing boilerplate.
- <strong>One click CI:</strong> Schedule or run tests on deployments with one click.
- <strong>Easy debugging:</strong> Understand failures with a video recording and
  detailed logs.
- <strong>Out of the box alerts:</strong> Send email or Slack alerts to your team.

We're constantly working to make QA Wolf even easier, so please <Link href="/docs/community"><a>reach out to us</a></Link> with questions or feedback.
