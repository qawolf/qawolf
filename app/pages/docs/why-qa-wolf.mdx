<Header>Why QA Wolf?</Header>

Hi there! 👋 Thanks for checking out QA Wolf, an <a href="https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf" target="_blank">open source tool</a> for browser testing. 

We built QA Wolf to help you create, run, and maintain tests 10x faster.

<SubHeader>Who is QA Wolf for?</SubHeader>

QA Wolf is for busy teams who want the fastest way to set up tests. We built it for developers like us who want to spend less time testing and more time shipping.

Our goal is to get you up and running with tests as quickly as possible. In order to do this, QA Wolf needs to be opionated. We optimize for speed and ease of use over configuration. QA Wolf works particularly well with the modern Jamstack.
