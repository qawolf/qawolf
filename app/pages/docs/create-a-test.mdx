<Header>Create a Test</Header>

QA Wolf helps you create tests on your web application. As you use your site, your actions are converted to <a href="https://playwright.dev/docs/core-concepts" target="_blank">Playwright</a> test code.

In this tutorial, we'll create a test on <a href='http://todomvc.com/examples/react' target="_blank">TodoMVC</a>.

<SubHeader>Open Editor</SubHeader>

If you haven't already, [sign up for QA Wolf](/sign-up).

Enter the URL you want to test in the input below your QA Wolf.

Note: If you want to test a local URL like `localhost:3000`, you need to use our local runner. <a className="open-intercom">Chat with us</a> and we'll help you get set up.

After the page loads, go through the workflow you want to test in the browser. In our example, we 1) created a todo item, 2) completed it, and 3) cleared completed todos.

As you use your site, your actions are converted to <a href="https://playwright.dev/docs/core-concepts" target="_blank">Playwright</a> test code. You can edit this code as you like, and you have full access to the <a href="https://playwright.dev/docs/api/playwright-module" target="_blank">Playwright API</a>.

<SubHeader>Run a Test</SubHeader>

Now that we have our test, let's run it by clicking the "Run" button. As your test runs, the current line of code is indicated by üê∫. ‚úÖ appears next to passing lines and ‚ùå appears next to failing lines.

You can view the logs from your test by clicking the "Logs" option next to "Code" above the code editor.
